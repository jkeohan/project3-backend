# Full-Stack App Group Project

## Presentation Buddy
Presentation Buddy makes it easy to plan your presentations and stay on time while you present.
1. Create your new presentation or open a saved one.
2. Edit your presentation with sections, estimated time per section, and talking points.
3. Push start! While you present, the timer counts down and turns red so you know when itâ€™s time for the next section.

## Motivation
_Everybody needs to present sometimes! We all loved this idea, a suggestion from Marshall's brother, and we ran it by more people for feedback along the way. We believe that many presenters could benefit from utilizing Presentation Buddy -- starting with us, when we present this project to our class on April 25, 2020!_

## Build status
Deployed [https://presentationbuddy.netlify.app/](https://presentationbuddy.netlify.app/)

## Built with
React, Mongo, Node, Express. 
(Additional: Styled-components, font-awesome icons)

## Features
The minimal design lets the user focus on what matters -- the time, and the presentation plan. Presentation Buddy automatically calculates the total time of your presentation based on the sections you add, and while you present, helpfully turns red so you know it's time to get to the next section, and how far behind you may be. Presentation Buddy re-calculates as you go, so you can watch the timer counting down, or the progress bar counting up, to know exactly where you're at in your presentation.
